        I have had the opportunity to work with Tristan Thompson for several years in the context of the FIRST

        Robotics Competition (FRC) program at the local high school (Lake Oswego School District). I work at a

        high tech company, Mentor Graphics. I am an engineer and manage a group of engineers in the

        development of engineering software products.

        My role in the robotics program is to provide mentoring specifically for robotic software development,

        using National Instruments LabVIEW software and other programming languages, but also more

        generally for leadership training. I have worked with Tristan in both of these areas.

        Even as a freshman, Tristan assumed the role of primary programmer for the robot. He was able to

        learn complex software concepts (such as feedback control) quickly. He was both inquisitive and

        resourceful, so he progressed at a rapid pace. He is now a sought-after technical resource on the

        robotics team, due to his breadth of knowledge. His skills with LabVIEW would qualify him to work in a

        professional engineering setting. In the past year, he took the initiative to learn java and rewrite all of

        the robot code in the java language. He is an instructor for other students learning these programming

        skills.

        Last year, as a junior, Tristan took on a more challenging task, as he has focused on developing more

        leadership skills. He took the initiative to be the team project manager, keeping track of the robot build

        schedule and task assignments. This was eye-opening for him, as he has experienced the “herding cats”

        phenomena typical to any project with a large number of diverse, volunteer participants. He succeeded

        in this role, but it required more perseverance than I think he was expecting.

        This year, Tristan is the captain for the robotics team. This is an FRC team that is serious about

        competing, so this is not just a resume-padding position. The big challenge for Tristan this year is

        learning how to motivate and direct at an even higher level than last year. Tristan is fundamentally a

        technical accomplishment-driven individual -- He wants to build and compete with the best robot

        possible. He is motivated to be a team leader because he would otherwise be unsatisfied with the

        outcome of the season.

        For the past six months, Tristan has also worked part-time in my group at Mentor Graphics, in the

        development of an innovative new modeling and simulation environment for engineers

        (www.systemvision.com). His role has been to develop a desktop tool that will access schematics, that

        have been developed online, and render them in a legacy desktop tool, for use offline. This is

        important, mainstream functionality for a commercial product. Tristan works in our group as a peer to

        very experienced software developers.

        Tristan’s hard work, resourcefulness, and positive attitude will serve him well in any organization that he

        joins. I recommend him, without reservation, for a role that is focused on technology and innovation.

        Tristan is going to be a strong asset in whatever college community that he joins. He will be strong both

        academically as well as in leadership roles. He has already learned more lessons about himself, and

        what he needs to do to be a good leader, than many adults ever do.

        Best regards,
