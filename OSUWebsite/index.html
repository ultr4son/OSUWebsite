	<p>I am a computer science freshman at Oregon State University</p>

	<h2> My good qualities </h2>
	<ul>
		<li> I can program! I can program so well that I got an internship at <a href = "https://www.mentor.com/">Mentor Graphics</a> In the summer of my Junior year. I then got hired and worked as a contractor the following year and over the summer. I also took an independent study my Junior year where I made a <a href = "https://github.com/ultr4son/VectorAdderAssembly">vector adder</a> and toyed around with making an arduino blink a light.</li>
		<li> The programming languages I know in order of proficiency are: <!-- screw css -->
			<ol>
				<li>Java</li>
				<li>Java Script</li>
				<li>C#</li>
				<li>Labview</li>
				<li>C++</li>
				<li>x86 Assembly</li>
				<li>AVR Assembly</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li> I can light! I was the lead lighting designer, setup, and board operator for <a href = "http://www.pacer-drama.org/">The Lakeridge Drama Program</a>.</li>
		<li> I can do <a href = "http://www.frc2635.org/"> robotics! </a>My interest in programming really developed when I joined robotics in the 9th grade. It's also where I got my internship from. I became software lead in Sophomore year, Project Manager and lead Robot Driver in Junior Year, and Team Captain in Senior year.</li>
        <li> I have a reference! You can see it <a href="Reference.html">here.</a></li>
	</ul>
	<hr>
	<h2>My projects/extras</h2>
	<p> I did a small interpreter/language project that I call <a href = "alphaUI.html">Alpha</a>. It's a semi-esoteric language that I based around the language in a game called <a href = "http://www.zachtronics.com/tis-100/">TIS-100</a>, a game that uses an assembler-like language. You can see a list of registers and commands <a href = "Alpha/alphaSpec.html"> here.</a></p>
	<br>
	<p>I type primarily in Devorak. This is a blessing and a curse.</p>
	<p>Right now I'm reverse engineering a mill control panel. I've kept the wire harnesses intact. It's taught me a lot about how keypads work.</p>
	<img src = "millpanel.jpg" class = "rotatedSmallImage" ><br>The panel.
	<p>I like collecting old hardware. I've collected lots of things over the years, including a working macintosh plus (I had to resolder the analog board at one point though), and a Commodore 64 with an original monitor, tape drive, modem, and two floppy drives.</p>
